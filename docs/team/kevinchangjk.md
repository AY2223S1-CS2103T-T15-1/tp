# Project: Coydir

**Coydir is a desktop application used by Human Resource Executives to streamline processes in managing their staffing.** The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

## Contributions

### Enhancements Implemented

- **New Features**

  - Implemented Employee ID system

    - Created an `EmployeeId` class to represent the unique ID of an employee in the company. The implementation can be seen [here](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/coydir/model/person/EmployeeId.java).
    - Use Case: User can distinguish employees through a distinct number.
    - Justification: This attribute of the employee completely removes any ambiguity of `Person` objects, as well as any possibility of duplicate employees recognised during commands.
    - Highlights: As a field with restrictions placed due to its uniquenes, it lacks modular depth as compared to other basic `Person` fields such as `Name` or `Phone`. It is also much harder to ensure smooth usage and testing due to its widespread implications.

  - Built home page
    - Created a simple home page with our logo.
    - Use Case: User will see the home page on startup, and for commands that do not need to display extra information.
    - Justification: Provides a nicer viewing for the user, and a smoother usage as opposed to blank screens.
    - Highlights: It was surprisingly difficult to adjust the positioning of the elements.

- **Existing Features**

  - Upgraded `find` function

    - Created a `Department` class for another dimension of categorization. Then modified `find` to build a search filter that can comprise of name, department, and/or job position.
    - Use Case: User can search for employees with varying levels of specificity.
    - Justification: With this command, users of Coydir will be able to look up information on specific employees or group of employees quickly.
    - Highlights: Relatively easier to implement than the Employee ID system.

  - Upgraded help window

    - Changed the default help window to provide a command summary. Additionally, instead of a button that copies the URL into register, the button opens the User Guide in the default browser of the user.
    - Use Case: User can now use the help window as a quick reference, and if need be, open up the User Guide for further information.
    - Justification: The help window now provides more utility, and accessing the User Guide is made faster and simpler.
    - Highlights: Implementing the function to open the User Guide in browser was slightly complex, and needed some workarounds. Building the interface for the help window was also particularly challenging.

  - Refactor `edit` function

  - Fixed multiple bugs (Refer to #150, #151, #232, #233).
