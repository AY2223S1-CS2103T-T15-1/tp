## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

Coydir v1.2 supports 3 user functions that allow for complete control of your company’s employee data.

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

- Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

- Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

- Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

- If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

:warning: **Integer input values cannot be too large**: any values greater than $2^{32}-1$ is not supported.

</div>

### Adding an employee: `add`

Adds an employee to Coydir.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL j/POSITION d/DEPARTMENT a/ADDRESS l/LEAVE [t/TAG]…​`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb:
An employee can have any number of tags (including 0).
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb:
The only compulsory fields are name, position and department.
Leaves will be default 14 while the other fields will be initialised as N/A.
</div>

Examples:

- `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com j/Recruiter d/Human Resources a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 l/20 t/friends t/owesMoney`
- `add n/Peter Mars j/Chief Operating Officer d/General Management`

### Editing an employee: `edit`

Edits the details of the person identified by the index number used in the displayed person list. Existing values will be overwritten by the input values.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [j/POSITION] [d/DEPARTMENT] [a/ADDRESS] [l/LEAVE] [t/TAG]…​`

Examples:

- `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com`
- `edit 2 p/91234567 l/20 t/colleagues`


### Adding multiple employees at once: `batchadd`

Adds multiple employees to Coydir all at once.

:warning: **Make sure to have uploaded CSV file to make use of this command, and that employees' fields are compatible with Coydir**: CSV file can be uploaded under the 'data' folder of Coydir.

:warning: **Fields to be added in batchadd would be name, phone, email, position, department, address, tags, and total number of leaves**

:warning: **Do not have commas between each field in the CSV file.**

This command results in one of two cases below:

**Case 1: CSV file exists**

if a CSV file of employees exists in the 'data' folder of Coydir, Coydir will read from the CSV file to add the employees.

**Case 2: CSV file does not exist**

if a CSV file does not exist in the 'data' folder of Coydir, Coydir will
throw an error.

Format: `batchadd FILENAME`

Example:

- `batchadd employees.csv`

### Listing all employees : `list`

Shows a list of all employees in the company.

Format: `list`

### View details of an employee: `view`

Views the details of an existing employee in the current list.

Format: `view INDEX`

Example:

- `view 2` returns the details of the second employee in the current list.

### Deleting an employee : `delete`

Deletes the specified employee from Coydir, given the employee ID.

This command results in one of two cases below:

**Case 1: Unique entry**

If Coydir has just 1 unique entry that matches the specified name, Coydir will delete it.

**Case 2: Multiple entries**

Otherwise, if Coydir has more than 1 entry that matches the specified name, Coydir will prompt users with a list of the matching entries, and await user confirmation for which entry to delete.

Format: `delete ID`

Example:

- `delete 1` deletes the employee with employee ID of 1.

### Finding an employee : `find`

Finds employees by searching for specified keywords. You can search for a specific name, position, or department, or with any combination of the aforementioned.

The keywords for searching are case-insensitive, and need not be full words. Running the command will then display all employees whose details match the specified keywords.

**Note**: There must be _at least one_ of the employees' particulars (and keywords) in the search.

Format: `find [n/NAME_KEYWORD] [j/POSITION_KEYWORD] [d/DEPARTMENT_KEYWORD]`

Example:

- `find n/John j/engineer d/Tech` displays the employee "John Doe", who is a "Software Engineer" in the "Information Technology" department.

### Adding a leave period for an employee: `addleave`

Adds a leave period to an employee given the employee ID and a start and end date.

This command results in one of two cases below:

**Case 1: Valid ID, date and sufficient leaves**

If the employee exists, the leave date given is valid,
and the employee has sufficient leaves, the leave period will be added and the total leaves remaining will be deducted accordingly.

**Case 2: Invalid ID, date or insufficient leaves**

If any of employee ID, date is invalid, or the employee does not possess enough leaves, Coydir will prompt the users accordingly, and the command will not execute.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb:
Leaves are ordered by reverse chronological order.
</div>

Format: `addleave id/ID sd/START_DATE ed/END_DATE`

Example:

- `addleave id/1 sd/01-01-2022 ed/02-01-2022` adds a leave period to an employee of ID 1 with a leave period from 01-01-2022 to 02-01-2022 of 2 days.

### Deleting a leave period for an employee: `deleteleave`

Removes a leave period for an employee given the employee ID and index of leave in the table.

This command results in one of two cases below:

**Case 1: Valid ID and index of leave**

If the employee exists, the index given is valid, the leave period at that index of the list of leaves will be removed for the particular employee.

**Case 2: Invalid ID, or index**

If the employee ID, or the index is invalid, Coydir will prompt the users accordingly, and the command will not execute.

Format: `deleteleave id/ID i/INDEX`

Example:

- `deleteleave id/1 i/3` deletes the third leave period for an employee of ID 1 in the list of leaves.

### View details of a department: `viewdepartment`

Ratings can take any values from 1 - 5, and it should not be blank.

The numeric representation of the ratings follows as such:
5: Outstanding | 4: Exceeds Expectations | 3: Satisfactory | 2: Needs Improvement | 1: Unsatisfactory

This command results in one of two cases below:

**Case 1: Valid ID and rating**

If the employee exists, the rating given is valid (is a number from 1-5 inclusive), the performance rating will be added and the performance field of the employee will be updated accordingly.

**Case 2: Invalid ID or rating**

If any of employee ID, the rating given is invalid (is not a number from 1-5 inclusive), Coydir will prompt the users accordingly, and the command will not execute.

Format: `rate id/ID r/RATING`

Example:

- `rate id/1 r/3` adds a performance rating to an employee of ID 1 with a rating of 3: Satisfactory.
