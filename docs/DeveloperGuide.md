### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/coydir/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/coydir/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,

- At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/coydir/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/coydir/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/coydir/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/coydir/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

- stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
- stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/coydir/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

- can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
- inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `coydirbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

- `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
- `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
- `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire Coydir

  - Pros: Easy to implement.
  - Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

- **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  - Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  - Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Add feature

#### Implementation

This section explains the implementation of the `add` feature. The command takes in two compulsory parameters which is the employee name and position, executing the command leads to the addition of an employee person into the records of coydir.

Below is a sequence diagram and explanation of how `add` is executed.

<img src="images/AddCommandUML.png" width="550" />

Step 1. The user enters the command `add n/Jon j/janitor`.

Step 2. User input is parsed by `AddCommandParser` which creates the`AddCommand` object, then the method LogicManager#execute is called to create the AddCommand object.

Step 3. The `execute` method of AddCommand is then called on the object, which returns a `CommandResult` object.

Step 4. This adds the `person` from the list from the model. The employeeID is set and if there already exist a `person` object with the same field data, a `CommandException` will be thrown and a message indicating duplicate person will be shown. If the `person` object does not exist, then using model#addPerson(), the `person` object is added to the `database`.

Step 5. storage#saveDatabase is then called on the current `database`, updates the database to contain the new `person`.


### Delete feature

#### Implementation (_Proposed_)

This section explains the implementation of the `delete` feature. The command takes in one parameter which is the employee ID, executing the command leads to the removal of the employee with that specific employee ID from coydir.

Below is a sequence diagram and explanation of how `delete` is executed.

<img src="images/DeleteCommandUML.png" width="550" />

Step 1. The user enters the command `delete 1`.

Step 2. User input is parsed by `DeleteCommandParser` which creates the `DeleteCommand` object, then the method `LogicManager#execute` is called to create the `DeleteCommand` object.

Step 3. The `execute` method of `DeleteCommand` is then called on the object, which returns a `CommandResult` object.

Step 4. This finds the `person` from the list from `model#getFilteredPersonList` by its employee ID which is `1` in this case. If there does not exist a `person` object with employee ID of `1`, a `CommandException` will be thrown and a message indicating invalid ID given will be shown. If the `person` object exists, then using `model#deletePerson()`, the `person` object is deleted from the `database`.

Step 5. storage#saveDatabase is then called on the current `database`, updates the database to not contain the deleted `person`.

### Find feature

This section explains the implementation of the `find` feature. The command takes in a number of parameters, which serve as the "filters" for the finding/searching function. At present, we have implemented finding by name, department, position, and any combination of these three. Thus it is possible to use these altogether to search for a person with high specificity.

Below is a sequence diagram and explanation of how `find` is executed. In this simple example, we will look at the command `find n/Alex`.

<img src="images/FindCommandUML.png" width="550" />

Step 1. The user enters the command `find n/Alex`.

Step 2. User input is parsed by `FindCommandParser` which creates the `FindCommand` object, then the method `LogicManager#execute` is called to create the `FindCommand` object.

Step 3. The `execute` method of `FindCommand` is then called on the object, which returns a `CommandResult` object.

Step 4. This then iterates through the list of `Person` objects returned by the `model#getFilteredPersonList` for the search parameter specified (in this case, name being "Alex"). It then keeps track of any `Person` objects that matches this specified parameter.

Step 5. The list of `Person` objects is then returned, and is passed to the `UiManager` to be displayed on the user interface.

### BatchAdd

This feature is created for users to add multiple entries at once.
In the case of this application, there are two main reasons why our User (HR Executive) would use this.

1. User is new and needs to import all the current data into the database.
2. There is a new recruitment cycle and company has recruited a large number of employees.

Moving on to the implementation, some things to note.

- As of now, our feature only accommodates adding from a CSV file.
- Fields does not allow for commas inside.

These are possible things to work on for future iterations.

#### Implementation

Pre-requisites: User has a CSV file filled with whatever information they have
and has stored it in the `/data` folder of the repository.

Step 1: User executes `batchadd filename` command. In the `LogicManager` class, the `DatabaseParser` method is called.
This will return a new `BatchAddParser` object and `parse` function is then called.
A helper function in `ParserUtil` helps to trim the filename and check if it is valid. If no argument is provided, a
`ParseException` will be thrown.

Step 2: The `parse` function returns a `BatchAddCommand` which is then executed. In this `execute` function, the first
step would be to read the information in the CSV file (`getInfo` function). A `BufferedReader` object is used to read the CSV file and write it
into a `List<AddCommand>`. If file does not exist in the folder, a `FileNotFound` exception is thrown too.

Step 3. Once `getInfo` returns a `List<AddCommand>`, the list will then be iterated through to execute each `AddCommand`
If there is any duplicate Person found, the function call will be aborted and the database will be reverted to its original state.

Step 4. `storage#saveDatabase` is then called on the current `database`, updates the database to contain the new persons added.

#### Design Considerations

- Alternative 1 (Current Choice): Make use of the execution of the `AddCommand`.
  - Pros: Makes use of the Error Handling that the `AddCommand` has.
  - Cons: `BatchAdd` will fail if Add fails.
- Alternative 2: Own implementation of `BatchAdd` without relying on `AddCommand`.
  - Pros: If Add Fails, BatchAdd can still work.
  - Cons: Implementation Heavy.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

Our target user is a Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO) who:

- types fast
- is comfortable with using CLI for inputting commands
- needs a centralized platform for accessing and updating employees’ data
- is a Top-level management executive in charge of an organization's employees

**Value proposition**:

Coydir enables the Company’s HR executive to quickly access the list of all employees, and make necessary updates based on changes in the company’s structure. This grants excellent visualization of the company structure, which will be useful in company organization or restructuring.
